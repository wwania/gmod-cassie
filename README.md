Central Autonomic Service System for Internal Emergencies, also known as C.A.S.S.I.E.is an automatic service system that is used for the management and mitigation of emergencies that occur within Site-02.

C.A.S.S.I.E. is a text-to-Speech system that uses a Domain-specific synthesis, meaning that the speech is not generated in real time and is instead created by using pre-recorded words and phrases said by a human.

Script lets you generate your own emergency messages, which will be heard by all players on server. You can change sound pitch, add jamming and lagging effects and pauses betweeen words.
